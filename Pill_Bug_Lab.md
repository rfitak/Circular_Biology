# Lab Experiment: Magnetoreception in pill bugs
In this lab, we are going to test two questions:
1. Do pill bugs move, or orient, in a preferred direction?
2. Does exposure to a pulsed magnetic field change pill bug orientation?
This is a multidiscplinary project, as we will learn concepts in physics, electronics, magnetics, sensory biology, behavior, and mathematics!!!  I hope you enjoy!

## A little background on pill bugs
Pill bugs, also known as sow bugs, potato bugs, or roly polies, are a terrestrial crustacean (yes, similar to lobsters, crabs, and barnacles) of the order Isopoda.  The common pill bug, *Armadillidium vulgare*, can be found throughout Europe and North America, although it has been introduced into North America. They are famous for their abiity to roll into a ball in order to protect themselves.  You can commonly find them underneath loose leaf litter or debris on the ground, often in cool, dark places.  They are absolutely harmless!!!! See the picture of a pill bug below taken from their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae).

However, it is not known if pill bugs can sense magnetic fields.  If you remember yesterday, we looked at data that demonstrated spiny lobsters change their orientation after exposure to a magnetic pulse, thus suggesting they can sense magnetic fields.  Since pill bugs are also crustaceans, perhaps they too have magnetoreception!  Although today's lab may not provide undisputable results, it is a first step.
## Experiment outline:
1.  Build a pulse-magnetizer
  * measure the magnetic field produced
2.  Examine pill big orientation before exposure to a magnetic field (Control)
   * repeat ≥10 trials
3. Expose pill bugs to a magnetic pulse (Pulsed)
    * repeat ≥10 trials
4. Calculate statistics and compare the Control and Pulsed groups.
