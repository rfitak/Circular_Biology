# Lab Experiment: Magnetoreception in pill bugs
In this lab, we are going to test two questions:
1. Do pill bugs move, or orient, in a preferred direction?
2. Does exposure to a pulsed magnetic field change pill bug orientation?

### A little background on pill bugs
Pill bugs, also known as sow bugs or roly polies, are a terrestrial crustacean (yes, similar to lobsters, crabs, and barnacles) of the order Isopoda.  They are famous for their abiity to roll into a ball in order to protect themselves.  See the picture of a pill bug below taken from their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae).
