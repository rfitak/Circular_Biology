# An Introduction to R
This tutorial introduces the statistical and graphical software suite R.  R is free, open-source software and one of the most powerful tools in the scientific and research community.  Although R does require some basic computer lingo, it can be learned quickly for most base-level analyses and plotting functions.

### Step 1:  Downloading and Installing R
R, and its graphical user interface (GUI) R-Studio, can be downloaded and installed from its website: [The R Project](https://www.r-project.org)
