# Orientation in pill bugs: an interdisciplinary activity to engage students in concepts of biology, physics, and circular statistics
This repository includes the detailed procedures for performing the pill bug laboratory exercise described in [insert publication here].  Links to different material describing the activity as well as for further reading and exploration are provided as blue, underlined clickable links. Any and all additions, comments, and criticisms are welcome and can be submitted either through GitHub as a "patch" or to my email (rfitak9@gmail.com).  On behalf of my coauthors who helped design this exercise (Eleanor Caves and SÃ¶nke Johnsen), we hope you enjoy the activity!

## Circular Statistics
If interested, the following tutorial on circular statistics can be included during classtime prior to the experiment day.  This tutorial is deisgned as a very basic introduction to the statistical software R and its utility for performing statistical tests and graphically visualizing data.  However, this tutorial can be skipped and the results analyzed either by hand (as described in the tutorial) or with alternative statistical software.

The tutorial can be found at the link below:
